	¿Who am I?  


	*¿Where are you from?    
*My name is Irene Isabel Rengifo and I'm from Panama. I was born in Mexico, my mother is from Panama and my father from Venezuela. I moved back to Panama at age 4 and lived there until 5 years ago that I moved to Spain.*
      
	*¿What do you do?    
*Currently I work at the Panamanian Embassy in Spain.*

	*¿Do you have previous experience with technology/data?  
*I studied Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, but I never actually worked in the technical field. I did work for a Telecommunications company, but in the administrative operational and process development area.* 

	¿Why am I here?  


	*¿What has brought you to Ironhack?  
*It was actually a scholarship announcement in 2019 by Deliveroo and I thought, well let's give it a try and I have to say a LOVED IT! mainly because i love challenges and I remember that they gave us some basic information, and when I went to the Ironhack campus, I was excepting something on that line, but it was actually a more difficult test and you had to actually use your logic, not only follow the commands they had given us and that's what I loved.* 

	*¿What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?  
*I would like to learn more about programming, coding and being able to have knowledge and know better tools to do analysis on data. I honestly think I would be very good in the field of Data Analytics.* 

	¿What will I do after the bootcamp?  


    *¿Which industry will you seek employment in?  
*Honestly, I think I'm very interested in the developing area, I have to say I do like creating things; or in the area of process developing, I like solving problems, reviewing data and identifying areas of improvement. If I could do this and mix it with my passion for animals would be like the EUROMILLON in my life.* 
    
	*¿What will your future role look like?
*I hope I would be able to work remotely from anywhere in the world, having a good salary, let's be honest, this is also very important nowadays (I wish I was a millionaire that could just do what I love and forget about cost of life, but I'm not); and off course in an area that I'm passionate about, being able to use my analytical skills on improving processes, coding or programming.* 
    
	 *¿What is your career goal?            
*Like I said earlier, my career goal or life goal actually would be to be able to use my skills on helping improve animal welfare and helping preserve endangered species in some way, while I could live with a good standard of Living, but a high quality of life.*
